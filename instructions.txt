Step 1
Begin with the basic HTML structure. Add a 
DOCTYPE declaration and html, head, body, 
and title elements.

Set the language of this page to English. 
Set the title to Piano.

Step 2
Add two meta tags, one to optimize your 
page for mobile devices, and one to specify 
an accepted charset for the page.

Step 3
Time to start working on the piano. 
Create a div element within your body element 
with the id set to piano.

Step 4
Nest a second div within your existing div, 
and set the class to be keys.

Step 5
Within your .keys element, add seven div 
elements. Give them all the class key.

Step 6
Remember that a class attribute can have 
multiple values. To separate your white 
keys from your black keys, you'll add a 
second class value of black--key. Add this 
to your second, third, fifth, sixth, and seventh 
.key elements.

Step 7
Now copy the set of seven .key elements, 
and paste two more sets into the .keys div.

Step 8
Add a link element within your head element. 
For that link element, set the rel attribute to 
stylesheet and the href to ./styles.css.

Step 9
Browsers can apply default margin and padding 
values to specific elements. To make sure your 
piano looks correct, you need to reset the box model.

Add an html rule selector to your CSS file, and 
set the box-sizing property to border-box.
