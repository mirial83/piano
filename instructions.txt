Step 1
Begin with the basic HTML structure. Add a 
DOCTYPE declaration and html, head, body, 
and title elements.

Set the language of this page to English. 
Set the title to Piano.

Step 2
Add two meta tags, one to optimize your 
page for mobile devices, and one to specify 
an accepted charset for the page.

Step 3
Time to start working on the piano. 
Create a div element within your body element 
with the id set to piano.

Step 4
Nest a second div within your existing div, 
and set the class to be keys.

Step 5
Within your .keys element, add seven div 
elements. Give them all the class key.

Step 6
Remember that a class attribute can have 
multiple values. To separate your white 
keys from your black keys, you'll add a 
second class value of black--key. Add this 
to your second, third, fifth, sixth, and seventh 
.key elements.

Step 7
Now copy the set of seven .key elements, 
and paste two more sets into the .keys div.

Step 8
Add a link element within your head element. 
For that link element, set the rel attribute to 
stylesheet and the href to ./styles.css.
